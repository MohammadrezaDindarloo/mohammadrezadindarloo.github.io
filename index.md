        <img src='/assets/img/projects/Diamond Calibration.png' class='project-img'>
        <p>DIAMOND is an eye surgery robot that employs a parallel spherical mechanism to create a Remote Center of Motion (RCM), facilitating minimally invasive surgery (MIS). In this project, we propose a relative pose measurement method calibrate the robot effectively. This work enhances the surgical training accuracy.</p>
