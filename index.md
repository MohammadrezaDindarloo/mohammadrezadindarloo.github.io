  Hello! My name is Mohammadreza Dindarloo, and I have recently completed my Master’s degree in Control Engineering from [K. N. Toosi University of Technology](https://en.kntu.ac.ir/). My research primarily focuses on optimization problems in robotics, including state estimation, calibration, and sensor fusion.

</div>

  <p>
    Since September 2019, I have been a research associate at the [ARAS (Applied Robotics and AI Solutions)](https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/) laboratory under the supervision of [Prof. Hamid D. Taghirad](https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/taghirad/). My work at ARAS has concentrated on the development of surgical and cable-driven robotic systems, with a particular emphasis on embedded systems, robotic control, and advanced optimization techniques.
